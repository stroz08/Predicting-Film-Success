# Predicting-Film-Success

This was a research project, done by Jacob Strozyk and Jacob Lush for the CSE 163 Data Programing course at the University of Washington, exploring whether certain film outcomes (ratings, revenue, etc.) could be accurately predicting using other various film statistics. We used Python libraries such as scikit-learn, matplotlib, and Pandas to generate our visualizations and ML models.

"Film ML Visualiation.py" contains the Python code to generate our visualizations and ML models used for predicting film statistics. It was originally a jupyter notebook file but I converted it to a Python file to be more GitHub friendly.
The PDF file is our report on our findings.
